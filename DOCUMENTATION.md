## Installation

> **Note**
> This addon requires sqlite to be installed to work

1. Install Statamic Redirect from the `Tools > Addons` section of your control panel, or via composer:

    ```
    composer require rias/statamic-redirect
    ```

## Usage

Redirect allows you to redirect legacy URLs, so that you don't lose SEO value when rebuilding & restructuring a website.

Redirect supports traditional exact and RegEx matching of URL patterns.

Redirect will also automatically create a redirect for you if you change an entry's slug or uri.

Unlike utilizing .htaccess to do redirects, Redirect does not add overhead to each request for each redirect you have in place.

Redirect has no impact on your website's performance until a 404 exception happens.

## Configuration

You can publish the config file using

```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=statamic-redirect-config
```

## Widgets

This addon comes with the following widgets:

- `errors`: for a listing of the most recent errors
- `errors_last_month`: the same chart as in the redirect dashboard
- `errors_last_week`: the same chart as in the redirect dashboard
- `errors_last_day`: the same chart as in the redirect dashboard

Widgets can be added to the dashboard by modifying the widgets array in the `config/statamic/cp.php` file.

```php
// config/statamic/cp.php

'widgets' => [
  [
      'type' => 'errors',
      'limit' => 5,
  ],
  'errors_last_month',
  'errors_last_week',
  'errors_last_day',
],
```

Like the default widgets of Statamic, you can also configure `title`& `width` of the widgets.

## Logging errors

By default, Statamic Redirect will create error logs, you can disable this by setting the `log_errors` config value to `false`.

## Logging individual hits

By default, Statamic Redirect will also keep individual hits for each error, you can disable this by setting the `log_hits` config value to `false`.

## Create entry redirects

By default, Statamic Redirect will create redirects when the URI of an entry changes. You can disable this by setting the `create_entry_redirects` config value to `false`.

## Deleting entry conflicting redirects

By default, Statamic Redirect will delete redirects when a saved entry's URI conflicts with the redirect. You can disable this by setting the `delete_conflicting_redirects` config value to `false`.

## Cleaning errors

The amount of errors can grow quickly, Statamic Redirect includes a scheduled command that by default cleans up errors older than 1 month.

You can disable the cleaning by setting the `clean_errors` config value to `false`. Or change the date range by changing the `clean_older_than` config value. This accepts a value that is parsed by PHP's [createfromdatestring](http://php.net/manual/en/dateinterval.createfromdatestring.php) function.

> Make sure your [Schedule](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/scheduling#introduction) is running for error cleaning to work.

## Different storage

If you want to use a different storage method for errors or redirects, change them in the config file.

### Errors

By default, errors are stored using the built-in `redirect-sqlite` connection. Picking another connection can be useful when logging a lot of errors & hits. To do this, change the `error_connection` config value. Provide `default` to use the default Laravel connection.

> When using a connection other than `redirect-sqlite`, make sure to publish (and run) the corresponding migration using `php artisan vendor:publish --tag="statamic-redirect-error-migrations"`.

### Redirects

By default, errors are stored in the `content/redirects` folder. Update the `redirect_store` config value to use a different folder.

It is also possible to store your redirects in the database. To do this, change the `redirect_connection` config value. Provide `default` to use the default Laravel connection.

> When using a connection other than `stache` or `redirect-sqlite`, make sure to publish (and run) the corresponding migration using `php artisan vendor:publish --tag="statamic-redirect-redirect-migrations"`.
